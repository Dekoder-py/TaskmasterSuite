# Taskmaster Suite
Nice to see you, yes it is! Welcome to the Taskmaster Suite project, a fun little private project which allows you to control a screen for an audience using a controller website. For detailed information on this project, visit https://sites.google.com/view/taskmastersuite/.

## Official Windows Releases
If you are NOT a developer, please go to [the latest release here](https://github.com/LocoMH/TaskmasterSuite/releases/latest). Here you will find the latest release of the Taskmaster Suite. Quick start information are also available.

## Mac and Linux support
As of now, the official releases contain only a Windows version. However as this project relies heavily on Python, it is not a big problem to run it also on Mac or Linux. You do need basic Python skills, though.

In order to install the necessary packages, browse to sources/app and install the project via

```pip install .```.

Of course I can only recommend to use a virtual environment for this.
Once installed, simply execute

```serve```

to start the application.
